I am a Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Texas at Austin, where I lead a research group studying extrasolar planets and star & planet formation. That is, I study the physics of how a cloud of gas and dust, floating in space, turns into a star like (or unlike) the Sun, orbited by planets like (or very much unlike) Earth.
